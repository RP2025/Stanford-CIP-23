This code is a calculator program written in Python, allowing users to perform various mathematical operations. Here is a breakdown of the functions within the code:

    main(): The main function of the program. It displays a menu of available operations and prompts the user for input. It then executes the corresponding operation based on the user's choice.
    addition(): Takes input from the user on how many numbers to add and then calculates their sum.
    subtraction(): Takes two numbers as input from the user and performs subtraction.
    multiplication(): Takes input from the user on how many numbers to multiply and then calculates their product.
    division(): Takes two numbers as input from the user and performs division.
    square_root(): Takes a number as input from the user and calculates its square root using the math.sqrt() function.
    exponent(): Takes two numbers as input from the user and calculates the exponentiation using the ** operator.
    sine(): Takes a value as input from the user and calculates the sine using the math.sin() function.
    cosine(): Takes a value as input from the user and calculates the cosine using the math.cos() function.
    tangent(): Takes a value as input from the user and calculates the tangent using the math.tan() function.
    radian_to_degree(): Takes a value in radians as input from the user and converts it to degrees using the math.degrees() function.
    degree_to_radian(): Takes a value in degrees as input from the user and converts it to radians using the math.radians() function.   
    exit_program(): Breaks the loop and exits the program.
    Invalid Input: Displays a message when an invalid input is provided by the user.

The program uses the math module for mathematical calculations such as square root, sine, cosine, tangent, and conversions between radians and degrees.
