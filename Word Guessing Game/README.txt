I made a word guessing game solely using Python for Final Project under Code in Place 2023 by Stanford University.

Game Description ::
        This is a game where you have to guess the chosen word by giving the programs the letter you think might be in the secret word. You are given 8 lives or guesses, which means that if you were to guess incorrectly, one point of your guess pool would be taken. If you get to 0 points, the game ends and you lose. If you guessed correctly, the letter you guessed will be displayed at the place where it is supposed to be. If your guess is a letter that you have already guessed before, and doesn't repeat itself in the word, no lives will be taken and your progress will remain the same.

        Changing the Lexicon is easy, you just have to change a variable at the beginning of a program,
allowing the user to choose their own word list to guess from.

Here I have given words based on programming only to save up the space. Feel free to add more words and make it more challenging!
